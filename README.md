jQuery Contact Manager

This project is my first jQuery project. This project has a CherryPy backend. The backend handles user registration and login and serving the base index page and scripts. The CherryPy server will also serve a contacts REST server. All work for the contacts interface and logic are handled in the JavaScript/jQuery scripts. Access to the contacts will be done in the jQuery UI via REST using the jQuery AJAX API.

This is a learning experience. If you find improvements, please share them with me. I am anxious to learn how to do anything better.
